      <p>Projects are an important tool for me to facilitate the uptake of my
        research by operational end users and to deepen my understanding of the
        needs of a wide range of clients both nationally and internationally. I
        am particularly interested in the process of building capacity in
        developing countries and in understanding how to deploy appropriate
        technology to a range of end users</p>
