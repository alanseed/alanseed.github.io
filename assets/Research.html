        High resolution forecasts of rainfall in the next 6 hours are needed as
        input for flash flood warning systems. I developed the first version of
        the Short-Term Ensemble Prediction System (STEPS) in collaboration with
        the Met Office (U.K). STEPS represents a major advance in the science of
        stochastic space/time rainfall modelling and provides a robust and fast
        algorithm for generating large ensembles of forecasts. Licenses for
        STEPS have issued for use in Japan, Canada, Russia, Belgium, Finland,
        Singapore, and Korea. I provided technical support for the development
        of pySTEPS, the open-source version of STEPS.

        Weather radar remains a key source of high-resolution rainfall data that
        are suitable for urban hydrological applications. I undertake research
        into algorithms that are needed for data quality control and radar
        rainfall estimation. I am especially interested in developing robust
        algorithms and managing the overall complexity of the system. I provided
        technical oversight for Rainfields, the Bureau’s operational national
        radar rainfall estimation system. Rainfields includes a suite of about
        50 algorithms to perform quality control on the incoming radar data and
        to use the data to estimate the rain rate on the ground. The use of
        commercial microwave links to estimate rainfall in urban areas and how
        to optimally blend fields that have an error structure that scales are
        also areas of interest to me.
