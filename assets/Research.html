    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">
        Research into the spatial and dynamic scaling structure of rainfall based on the analysis of large sets of high-resolution radar data. Of particular interest is the use of simplified versions of a cascade model for use in real-time applications, generating anisotropic fields, and the role of non-stationarity over large domains.

    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">
        High resolution forecasts of rainfall in the next 6 hours are needed as input for flash flood warning systems. I developed the first version of the Short-Term Ensemble Prediction System (STEPS) in collaboration with the Met Office (U.K). STEPS represents a major advance in the science of stochastic space/time rainfall modelling and provides a robust and fast algorithm for generating large ensembles of forecasts. Licenses for STEPS have issued for use in Japan, Canada, Russia, Belgium, Finland, Singapore, and Korea. I provided technical support for the development of pySTEPS, the open-source version of STEPS.

  <h5 class="card-title">Radar rainfall estimation</h5>
  <div class="card-body">
  <p class="card-text">
    Weather radar remains a key source of high-resolution rainfall data that are suitable for urban hydrological applications. I undertake research into algorithms that are needed for data quality control and radar rainfall estimation. I am especially interested in developing robust algorithms and managing the overall complexity of the system. I provided technical oversight for Rainfields, the Bureauâ€™s operational national radar rainfall estimation system. Rainfields includes a suite of about 50 algorithms to perform quality control on the incoming radar data and to use the data to estimate the rain rate on the ground.
