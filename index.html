      I am a research scientist with a strong engineering background, and as such am motivated 
      to conduct high quality research that delivers practical outcomes. I am well known within 
      Australia and internationally for my research into space-time stochastic models of rainfall 
      and for quantitative radar rainfall estimation and nowcasting.
