      <p class="card-text"> 
        I am a data scientist with experience in developing stochastic models that generate ensemble forecasts of non-Gaussian random fields that have scaling properties in both space and time. I have a proven ability to communicate complex mathematics and analysis in a simple, clear, at a level of detail that is appropriate for the audience. I have a passion for mentoring junior colleagues and have enjoyed co-supervising post graduate students at Australian and International Universities. My skills in data analysis have been honed while developing fast and reliable models that are suitable for real-time operational systems.
